# ðŸ”§ UltraThink Language Fix - Agent Responses

## Problem Identified
The user reported that agent responses in UltraThink are still coming in Portuguese despite selecting English in the UI.

## Root Cause
1. The UltraThink workflow (`ultrathink-workflow.js`) was not passing language information to AI requests
2. Hardcoded Portuguese message in progress updates
3. Missing language instruction in AI prompts

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Updated `ultrathink-workflow.js`
- Added `getLanguageInstruction()` method to support multiple languages
- Fixed hardcoded Portuguese progress message (line 199)
- Added language instruction to AI prompts (line 232)

### 2. Updated `server/routes/warroom.js`
- Modified `handleUltrathinkWorkflow` to pass language parameter from workflow object
- Added language logging for debugging

### 3. Verified Frontend
- Confirmed `sendUltraThinkPhase` already sends `language: selectedLanguage` parameter
- Language is correctly sent from frontend to server

## How to Test

### 1. Set Language to English
```javascript
// In browser console before opening WarRoom:
localStorage.setItem('warroom-language', 'en-US');
```

### 2. Open WarRoom
Navigate to http://localhost:5173/warroom

### 3. Test UltraThink
Type: "help me build a DeFi trading platform"

### 4. Expected Results
- UI should be in English âœ…
- Phase messages should be in English âœ…
- Agent responses should now be in English âœ…

## What Changed

### Before:
```javascript
// No language instruction
content: `You are ${agent.name}, a ${agent.role}...`

// Hardcoded Portuguese
`${agent.name} estÃ¡ analisando o projeto...`
```

### After:
```javascript
// With language instruction
content: `You are ${agent.name}, a ${agent.role}...
${languageInstruction}` // "Respond in English."

// Dynamic language support
const progressMessage = context.language === 'en-US' ? 
  `${agent.name} is analyzing the project...` : ...
```

## Status: âœ… FIXED
The language parameter is now properly passed through the entire UltraThink workflow chain.
