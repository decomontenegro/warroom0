# ðŸŽ¨ Graph Visualization Improvements

## What Was Improved

The radial, hierarchical, and circular layouts in the AgentNetworkMap component have been enhanced to be more dynamic, interactive, and visually appealing.

### 1. **Radial Layout** â­•
- **Dynamic radius variation**: Nodes gently pulse in and out
- **Layer rotation**: Each layer rotates at different speeds
- **Smooth animations**: Continuous motion when in dynamic mode
- **Visual hierarchy**: Inner layers rotate slower than outer layers

### 2. **Hierarchical Layout** ðŸ“‹
- **Wave effect**: Horizontal wave motion for nodes at each level
- **Floating animation**: Gentle vertical floating for each level
- **Level-based timing**: Different animation phases for each hierarchy level
- **Organic movement**: Creates a more natural, flowing appearance

### 3. **Circular Layout** ðŸ”„
- **Circle pulsation**: The entire circle breathes in and out
- **Continuous rotation**: All nodes rotate around the center
- **Individual node pulse**: Each node has its own pulse timing
- **Smooth transitions**: Seamless animation loops

## New Features Added

### Interactive Enhancements
1. **Hover Effects**:
   - Nodes grow and glow on hover
   - Connected links are highlighted
   - Non-connected links fade for better focus

2. **Layout Switching**:
   - Smooth transitions between layouts
   - Auto-enables dynamic mode for non-force layouts
   - Visual indicators (emojis) in dropdown

3. **Keyboard Shortcuts** (when expanded):
   - `1` - Force Directed layout
   - `2` - Radial layout
   - `3` - Hierarchical layout
   - `4` - Circular layout
   - `D` - Toggle dynamic mode

4. **Visual Feedback**:
   - Dynamic indicator (âœ¨) shows when animations are active
   - Layout-specific CSS animations
   - Enhanced glow and shadow effects

## Technical Implementation

### Animation System
- Uses `requestAnimationFrame` for smooth 60fps animations
- Separate animation logic for each layout type
- Conditional rendering based on dynamic mode
- Optimized performance with minimal redraws

### Code Structure
```javascript
// Example of radial animation logic
const radiusVariation = Math.sin(Date.now() * 0.001 + nodeIndex * 0.5) * 10
const rotationSpeed = 0.0002 * (layerIndex + 1)
const angle = baseAngle + (Date.now() * rotationSpeed)
```

## How to Use

1. **Open the graph**: Click on the network map in the bottom right
2. **Expand view**: Click the expand button (â›¶)
3. **Change layout**: Use the dropdown or keyboard shortcuts
4. **Toggle animations**: Use the "DinÃ¢mico" checkbox or press 'D'
5. **Interact**: Hover over nodes, drag them around, zoom in/out

## Performance Considerations

- Animations are GPU-accelerated using CSS transforms
- Only active when "DinÃ¢mico" is enabled
- Automatic cleanup when component unmounts
- Optimized for 100+ nodes

## Visual Examples

- **Force Layout**: Traditional spring-based physics simulation
- **Radial Layout**: Concentric circles with rotating layers
- **Hierarchical Layout**: Horizontal levels with wave motion
- **Circular Layout**: Single circle with rotation and pulsation

The improvements make the graph visualization more engaging and help users better understand the relationships between agents in the UltraThink system.
