# War Room AI Integration Setup

The War Room AI features are now fully integrated and working. The system will use mock responses by default, but can be configured to use real AI through OpenRouter.

## Current Status

✅ AI endpoints are working (`/api/warroom/ai/*`)
✅ Frontend integration is complete
✅ WebSocket communication is established
✅ Mock AI responses provide realistic simulations
✅ Fallback to mock responses when API is unavailable

## To Enable Real AI Responses

1. **Get an OpenRouter API Key**
   - Go to https://openrouter.ai/
   - Sign up for an account
   - Generate an API key from the dashboard

2. **Update Your Configuration**
   - Edit the `.env` file in the project root
   - Replace the `OPENROUTER_API_KEY` with your valid key:
     ```
     OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-actual-api-key-here
     ```

3. **Restart the Server**
   - Stop the current server (Ctrl+C in the terminal)
   - Run `npm run dev:server` again

## Testing the Integration

### Web Interface
1. Open http://localhost:5173/warroom
2. Enter a task description (e.g., "implement user authentication")
3. Click "Start Session"
4. Watch as AI agents analyze and discuss the task

### CLI Interface
The Claude-like CLI interface is also available:
```bash
warroom smart
```

### Direct API Testing
```bash
# Test the AI discussion endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:3005/api/warroom/ai/discuss \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "task": "implement a caching system",
    "context": {"mode": "test"},
    "sessionId": "test-session"
  }'
```

## Mock vs Real AI

**Mock AI (Default)**
- No API key required
- Instant responses
- Realistic simulation for development
- Good for testing UI/UX flow

**Real AI (With Valid API Key)**
- Requires valid OpenRouter API key
- Actual AI-powered responses
- More diverse and contextual answers
- May incur API costs

## Architecture

The AI integration follows the ULTRATHINK multi-agent approach:
- **SessionOrchestrator**: Manages team composition and workflow
- **AIDialogModerator**: Facilitates agent discussions
- **ValidationPipeline**: Ensures quality and correctness
- **CodeAnalyzer**: Analyzes code patterns and quality
- **RequirementsAnalyzer**: Extracts and validates requirements
- **TestGenerator**: Creates test scenarios

Each agent provides a unique perspective on the task, creating a comprehensive analysis through collaborative discussion.
